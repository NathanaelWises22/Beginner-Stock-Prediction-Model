# Beginner-Stock-Prediction-Model
First attempt at Machine Learning!!
I am always very curious about how the High-Frequency Trading and some 'whale' use a program to do their trades. This is a code i found from https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/ about
'Stock Prices Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques (python codes)'.
While it is far from a 'independent stock trading program'. as it is my first time learning about Programming and Machine Learning, this project really gives me a lot of insight and new material to learn about.
